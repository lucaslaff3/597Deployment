# Predictive Model Deployment

### This repository contains:
  ### Project Workfile.ipynb: A jupyter notebook, which contains cells for training, testing and tuning for the developed models, as well as some testing for our server to clarify that it is running properly.
  ### app.py: A Python script for posting our model to an Azure server, as well as creating endpoints for model to be reached at to return a predicted result.
