# Predictive Model Deployment

### This repository contains:
  ### Project Workfile.ipynb: A jupyter notebook, which contains cells for training, testing and tuning for the developed models, as well as some testing for our server to clarify that it is running properly.
  ### app.py: A Python script for posting our model to the established Azure server. It then, through Flask, creates an endpoint for the model to be reached at and returns a predicted result. 

# Necessary Packages can be found within the requirements.txt File
